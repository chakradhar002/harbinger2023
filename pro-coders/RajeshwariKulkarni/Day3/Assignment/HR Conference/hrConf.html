                    The bottom line – HR managers are in charge of many duties, but employee well-being should always remain a top priority. As a human resource manager, you’ll spend a lot of time speaking to
                    employees, listening to concerns, and managing workplace relationships. The main goal of a successful, strategic HRM should be to ensure the staff feels safe, respected, and heard at all times
