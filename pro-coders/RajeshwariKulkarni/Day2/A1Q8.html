                        It must be tough, being a cat and not a dog. Thousands of years before there was any such animal as a domestic cat, dogs had already run off with all the prizes for faithfulness, loyalty, and just being “man’s best friend”. Or rather, they would have run a short way and then turned right around and headed back again, because dogs’ place is,
