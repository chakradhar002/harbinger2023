                  It was an evolutionary process. People often ask what my big break was, and I can honestly say that I didn’t really have one. I just had lots of very small, incremental steps. I clawed my way up. I realized that if I were going to be a designer and not a craftsperson, these are the clients I’d need. Of course, it’s a catch-22, because these sorts of companies don’t normally take you seriously until you’ve worked with other such organizations. Then, very ironically, they can be the least intellectually demanding and satisfying clients, because you’re not working with an individual, you’re working with a corporation. Or, if you are working with an individual, they may only be there for a certain period of time, and you’re at the mercy of their credibility.
