                    Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next.

                    In a new interview, Anurag Kashyap praised SS Rajamouli and RRR song Naatu Naatu. According to Anurag, a song like Naatu Naatu, which has been nominated for Oscars 2023, is 'so hard to pull off' that only a director like Rajamouli with 'vision, courage and nerves of steel' could do it. Anurag further spoke about how 'everybody in the West is trying to reach out to Rajamouli now'. The filmmaker added Rajamouli was the 'perfect director for a DC or a Marvel film'

                    Science may be as old as the human species,[3] and some of the earliest archeological evidence for scientific reasoning is tens of thousands of years old. The earliest written records in the history of science come from Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 BCE. Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes.[4]: 12 [5] After the fall of the Western Roman Empire,
