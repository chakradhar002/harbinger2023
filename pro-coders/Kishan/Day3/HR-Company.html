            <h3>HR For Small Bussiness</h3>
            <p>
               John R. Commons, an American institutional economist, first coined the term human resource in his book The Distribution of Wealth, published in 1893. However, it was not until the 20th century that HR departments were formally developed and tasked with addressing misunderstandings between employees and their employers.
               KEY TAKEAWAYS
               Human resources (HR) is the division of a business responsible for finding, screening, recruiting, and training job applicants.
               HR also administers employee-benefit programs.
               A human resources department also handles compensation and benefits, and employee terminations.
               It must keep up to date with any laws that may affect the company and its employees.
