           <p>
            At its simplest form, artificial intelligence is a field, which combines computer science and robust datasets, to enable problem-solving.
            <b>It also encompasses sub-fields of machine learning </b>and deep learning, which are frequently mentioned in conjunction with artificial intelligence. 
            These disciplines are comprised of AI algorithms which seek to create expert systems which make predictions or classifications based on input data.

            Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of 
            <i>computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks
            </i>that typically require human intelligence.
            AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine 
            learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the 
            tech industry. </p>
            <p>
            Artificial intelligence allows machines to model, and even improve upon, the capabilities of the human mind. From the development of self-driving cars to the proliferation of smart assistants like Siri and Alexa, AI is a growing part of everyday life. As a result, many tech companies across various industries are investing in artificially intelligent technologies.
