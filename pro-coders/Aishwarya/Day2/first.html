 <h3>Nature Heals</h3>
 <p>
   Being in nature, or even viewing scenes of nature, reduces anger, fear, and stress and increases pleasant feelings. 
   Exposure to nature not only <i>makes you feel better emotionally,</i> it contributes to your physical wellbeing, reducing blood pressure, 
   heart rate<q>muscle tension, and the production of stress </q>  hormones. </p>
   
   <p>
   It may even reduce mortality, <i>according to scientists such as public health </i>researchers Stamatakis and Mitchell.
   Research done in hospitals, offices, and schools has found that even a simple plant in a room can have a significant impact on stress and anxiety.
