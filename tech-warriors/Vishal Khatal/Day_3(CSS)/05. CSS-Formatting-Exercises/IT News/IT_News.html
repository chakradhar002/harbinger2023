                The EHR and integrated healthcare IT vendor was hit with the new ransomware variant, in operation since late 2021. Operations are back to normal, the company reports. The group, also known as ALPHV and suspected to be a successor to BlackMatter, has demanded ransoms as high as $1.5M with affiliates keeping 80-90%, according to the Office of Information Security at U.S. Health and Human Services and the Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center.

            <p><span class="heading">Netflix says it plans to halt free password sharing before April</span><br>
                <span class="date"> <br> <b>Jan 27 2023</b> </span><br><br> 

             Netflix will begin blocking subscribers from sharing their account passwords with people outside of their household in the coming months, the video streaming service suggested in a letter to shareholders last week. 

             The streaming giant first hinted at plans to restrict Netflix password-sharing between households last spring.
             
             Netflix piloted a paid-version of account sharing in Latin American countries, where subscribers could add a “sub-account” for an additional $3 a month. 
             
             Now, it plans to roll out paid sharing “more broadly later in Q1,” which ends on March 31st.
