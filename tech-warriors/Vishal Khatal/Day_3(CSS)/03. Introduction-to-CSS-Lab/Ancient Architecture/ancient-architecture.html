            <p>Axncient Roman architecture adopted the
               external language of classical Greek architecture
               for the purposes of the ancient Romans, but
               grew so different from Greek buildings as to
               become a new architectural style. The two styles
               are often considered one body of classical
               architecture. Roman architecture flourished in
               the Roman Republic and even more so under
               the Empire, when the great majority of surviving
               buildings were constructed It used new
               materials, particularly concrete, and newer
               technologies such as the arch and the dome to
               make buildings that were typically strong and
               well-engineered. Large numbers remain in some
               form across the empire, sometimes complete
               and still in use.

            <p>The architecture of ancient Greece is the
               architecture produced by the Greek-speaking
               people (Hellenic people) whose culture
               flourished on the Greek mainland, the
               Peloponnese, the Aegean Islands, and in
               colonies in Anatolia and Italy for a period from
               about 900 BC until the 1st century AD, with the
               earliest remaining architectural works dating
               from around 600 BC[1] Ancient Greek
               architecture is best known from its temples,
               many of which are found throughout the region,
               mostly as ruins but many substantially intact.
               The second important type of building that
               survives all over the Hellenic world is the open-
               air theatre, with the earliest dating from around
               525-480 BC.

               ancient architectural remains, the most
               characteristic are the temples, Chaityas,
               Viharas, Stupas and other religious structures.
               In ancient India, temple architecture of high
               standard developed in almost all regions. The
               distinct architectural style of temple construction
               in different parts was a result of geographical.
               climatic, ethnic, racial, historical and linguistic
               diversities. The Rock-cut structures present the
               most spectacular piece of ancient Indian art
               specimen. Most of the rock-cut structures were
               related to various religious communities.
