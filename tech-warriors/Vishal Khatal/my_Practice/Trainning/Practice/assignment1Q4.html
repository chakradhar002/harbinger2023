    <h1>FIFA World Cup</h1>
    <p>The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by 
        the senior men's national teams of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), 
        the sport's global governing body. The tournament has been held every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930,
         except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. The reigning champions are Argentina, who won 
         their third title at the 2022 tournament.
        The format involves a qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify
         for the tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 32 teams compete for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over 
         about a month. The host nation(s) automatically qualify to the group stage of the tournament. The FIFA World Cup has been
          scheduled to expand to 48 teams for the 2026 tournament.</p>
