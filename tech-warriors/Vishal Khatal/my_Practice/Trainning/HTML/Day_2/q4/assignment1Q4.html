    <h1>World Cup News</h1>
    <p>The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested
        by the senior men's national teams of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA),
        the sport's global governing body. </p>
    <p>The tournament has been held every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held
        because of the Second World War. The reigning champions are Argentina, who won their third title at the 2022 tournament.
        The format involves a qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which
        teams qualify for the tournament phase.</p>
    <p>In the tournament phase, 32 teams compete for the title at venues within the host
    nation(s) over about a month. The host nation(s) automatically qualify to the group stage of the tournament. The FIFA World Cup has 
    been scheduled to expand to 48 teams for the 2026 tournament.</p>
