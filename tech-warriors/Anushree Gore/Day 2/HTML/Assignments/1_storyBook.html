        <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 16px;">The densely detailed paper, "A molecular signature defining exercise adaptation with ageing and in vivo partial reprogramming in skeletal muscle," lists a whopping 16 co-authors, six of whom are affiliated with the University of Arkansas. 
            The corresponding author is Kevin Murach, an assistant professor in the University's Department of Health, Human Performance and Recreation, and the first author is Ronald G. Jones III, a Ph.D. student in Murach's Molecular Muscle Mass Regulation Laboratory.</p>
            
        <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 16px;">The Yamanaka factors are four protein transcription factors (identified as Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, often abbreviated to OKSM) that can revert highly specified cells (such as a skin cell) back to a stem cell, which is a younger and more adaptable state. 
            The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Dr. Shinya Yamanaka for this discovery in 2012. 
            In the correct dosages, inducing the Yamanaka factors throughout the body in rodents can ameliorate the hallmarks of aging by mimicking the adaptability that is common to more youthful cells.</p>
