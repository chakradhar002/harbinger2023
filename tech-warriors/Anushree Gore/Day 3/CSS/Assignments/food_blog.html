         <p>How did we ever manage to cook before the arrival of the internet? I suppose we had to rely on cookbooks,
            cooking tv shows, and knowledge handed down from our grandmothers. Of course, the more daring would 
            experiment in the kitchen, remembering the successes, and mercifully forgetting any culinary disasters.

         <p>Love and Lemons has been created by Jeanine Donofrio and her husband, Jack Mathews (“#1 taste-tester”). The blog’s name comes from the fact that Jeanine loves seasonal food, often finished off with a squeeze of lemon.
            Most of the recipes on the site are vegetarian.
