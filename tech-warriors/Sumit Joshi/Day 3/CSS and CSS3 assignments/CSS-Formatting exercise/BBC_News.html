                    The rupee fell 28 paise to close as 81.70 (provisional) against the US dollar on 
                    Tuesday as unabated foreign fund outflow hit market sentiments.However, a weak dollar
                    and fall in crude prices capped the losses in the local currency, forex traders said.

                    The future of a country and the well-being of its citizens are directly related to
                    the quality of education it provides to its children and adolescents. Eduction adds 
                    meaning to our lives and gives us a sense of belonging and purpose in life, besides 
                    offering stability. Besides making you a productive citizen of a country, it also 
                    helps you to become responsible and aware about all those things that contribute to 
                    world peace and wellness.

                    India openers Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill blasted a 212-run partnership off just 
                    26.1 overs to get India off to a flying start in the 3rd ODI against New Zealand on 
                    Tuesday.Having been put in to bat first after the Black Caps won the toss, the duo 
                    scored a century each, utilising the short boundaries and batting friendly surface 
                    at the Holkar Cricket Stadium in Indore.

                    Locals from the Ryukyu Islands were the first to notice that the “iconic yet endangered” 
                    Amami rabbit was nibbling on the fruit of another local species, the plant Balanophora 
                    yuwanensis, says Kenji Suetsugu, a biologist at Kobe University in Japan.Rabbits generally 
                    like to eat vegetative tissue from plants, like leaves and stems, and so haven’t been thought to 
                    contribute much to spreading seeds, which are often housed in fleshy fruits.
