                <p class="article1">Ancient Roman architecture adopted the external language of classical Greek architecture for the purposes of the 
                ancient Romans, but grew so different from Greek buildings as to become a new architectural style. The two styles are 
                often considered one body of classical architecture Roman architecture flourished in the Roman Republic and even more 
                so under the Empire, when the great majority of surviving buildings were constructed It used new materials particularly 
                concrete, and newer technologies such as the arch and the dome to make buildings that were typically strong and 
                well-engered. Large numbers remain in some form at the empire sometimes complete and still in use</p>

                    The he architecture of ancient Greece is the architecture produced by the Greek-speaking people (Hellenic people) 
                    whose culture flourished on the Greek mainland, the Peloponnese, the Aegean Islands, and in colonies in Anatolia and 
                    Italy for a period from about 900 BC until the 1st century AD, with the earliest remaining architectural works dating 
                    from around 600 BC [1] Ancient Greek architecture is best known from its temples, many of which are found throughout 
                    the region, mostly as ruins but many substantially intact. The second important type of building that survives all 
                    over the Hellenic world is the open- air theatre, with the earliest dating from around 525-480 BC.
