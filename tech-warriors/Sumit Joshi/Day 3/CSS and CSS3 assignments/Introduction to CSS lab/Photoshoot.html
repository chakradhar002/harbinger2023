                    In this tutorial, we are creating a photo shoot effect with our just-released PhotoShoot jQuery plug-in. With it 
                    you can convert a regular div on the page into a photo shooting stage simulating a camera-like feel.<br>

                    commitment to the picturesque region the firm serves
