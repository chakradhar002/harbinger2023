        <p>He initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has
            been produced since March 2019 and went on sale in May 2019.The styling of the original Supra
            was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was both longer and wider.Starting in mid-1986,
            the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix
            Celica and named the car Supra.Owing to the similarity and past of the Celica's name, it is
            frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. The first, second and third generations of the
            Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the fourth generation was assembled
            at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City. The 5th generation of the Supra is assembled
            alongside the G29 BMW Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna Steyr.</p>

            The Supra also traces much of its roots back to the 2000GT owing to an inline-6 layout.
            The first three generations were offered with a direct descendant to the Crown's and 2000GT's M
            engine. Interior aspects were also similar, as was the chassis code "A".Along with this name, Toyota
            also included its own logo for the Supra. It was derived from the original Celica logo, being blue
            instead of orange. This logo was used until January 1986, when the A70 Supra was introduced.
            The new logo was similar in size, with orange writing on a red background, but without the dragon
            design. That logo, in turn, was on Supras until 1991 when Toyota switched to its current oval
            company logo. (The dragon logo was a Celica logo regardless of what colour it was. It appeared
            on the first two generations of the Supra because they were officially Toyota Celicas. The dragon
            logo was used for the Celica line until it was also discontinued.)[citation needed]

            In April 1978, Toyota began production of the Supra in Japan, as the Celica XX, and sold
            it alongside the Celica at Japanese dealership sales channels called Toyota Corolla Store.
            The Supra was offered with a 125 PS (92 kW; 123 hp) 2.0 L 12-valve SOHC inline-six engine
            (M-EU, chassis code MA45) or the 82 kW (110 hp; 111 PS) 2.6-liter 12-valve SOHC inline-six
            engine (4M-E, chassis code MA46). The Japanese model was equipped with the smaller 2.0 L
            engine so that buyers would not incur an additional tax under vehicle size and engine displacement
            regulations. Both engines were equipped with electronic fuel injection.The installation of the larger
            engine did obligate Japanese buyers to pay a higher annual road tax, making owning the car more expensive
            than the smaller Celica.The Supra was first exported outside Japan in January 1979.The federalized
            model was originally equipped with a 110 hp (82 kW; 112 PS) 2.6-liter 12-valve SOHC inline-6 engine.
