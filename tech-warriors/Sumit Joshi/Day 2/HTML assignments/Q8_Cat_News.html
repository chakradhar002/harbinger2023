            <p>Living With Loulou is maybe a little like turning the pages of the I Ching. Any one day’s blog, 
                if you decide to read it, might have an answer you were searching for! I know that’s pretty serious so let me say, too, 
                that I love to do my blog with humor and silliness and hope you’ll smile or even 
                maybe laugh out loud at some of my crazy ideas about every subject on earth. 
                If I can do that, than I’ve done my tiny part to help the world spin in a kind and 
                gentle direction.</p>
