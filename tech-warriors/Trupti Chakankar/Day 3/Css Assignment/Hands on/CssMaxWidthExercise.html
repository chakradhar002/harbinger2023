        <p class="a">A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a writer to tackle writers' block.
             Writing block can often happen due to being stuck with a current project that the writer is trying to complete.
              By inserting a completely random paragraph from which to begin, 
              it can take down some of the issues that may have been 
              causing the writers' block in the first place.</p>
