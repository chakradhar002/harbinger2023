3a.Query - alter table actor add COLUMN middle_name varchar(200) AFTER first_name;

3b. You realize that some of these actors have tremendously long last names. Change the data type of the middle_name column to blobs.

4c. Oh, no! The actor HARPO WILLIAMS was accidentally entered in the actor table as GROUCHO WILLIAMS, the name of Harpo's second cousin's husband's yoga teacher. Write a query to fix the record.

4C.Query -  update actor set first_name='HARPO' where first_name='GROUCHO'AND last_name='WILLIAMS';

4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing GROUCHO to HARPO. It turns out that GROUCHO was the correct name after all! In a single query, if the first name of the actor is currently HARPO, change it to GROUCHO. Otherwise, change the first name to MUCHO GROUCHO, as that is exactly what the actor will be with the grievous error. BE CAREFUL NOT TO CHANGE THE FIRST NAME OF EVERY ACTOR TO MUCHO GROUCHO, HOWEVER! (Hint: update the record using a unique identifier.)
