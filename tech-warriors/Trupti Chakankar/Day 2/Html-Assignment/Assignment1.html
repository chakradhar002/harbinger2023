<h1>Causes of Global Warming</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>
Global warming has become a grave problem which needs undivided attention. 
It is not happening because of a single cause but several causes. 
These causes are both natural as well as manmade.
 The natural causes include the release of greenhouses gases 
 which are not able to escape from earth,
 causing the temperature to increase.</p>
