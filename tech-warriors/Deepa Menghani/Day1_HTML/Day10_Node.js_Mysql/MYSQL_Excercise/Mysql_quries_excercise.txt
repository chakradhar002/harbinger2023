1a. Display the first and last names of all actors from the table actor.
=>  select first_name,last_name from actor;

1b. Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column in upper case letters. Name the column Actor Name.
=>  SELECT UPPER(CONCAT(first_name,' ', last_name)) AS 'Actor Name' FROM actor;

2a. You need to find the ID number, first name, and last name of an actor, of whom you know only the first name, "Joe." What is one query would you use to obtain this information?
=>  SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name FROM actor WHERE first_name = 'Joe';

2b. Find all actors whose last name contain the letters GEN:
=>  SELECT * FROM actor WHERE last_name LIKE '%GEN%';


2c. Find all actors whose last names contain the letters LI. This time, order the rows by last name and first name, in that order:
=>  SELECT first_name, last_name FROM actor WHERE last_name LIKE '%LI%'

2d. Using IN, display the country_id and country columns of the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and China:	
=>  SELECT country_id, country from country WHERE
country IN('Afghanistan', 'Bangladesh','China');

3a. Add a middle_name column to the table actor. Position it between first_name and last_name. Hint: you will need to specify the data type.
=>  ALTER TABLE actor ADD middle_name VARCHAR(50);

3b. You realize that some of these actors have tremendously long last names. Change the data type of the middle_name column to blobs.
=>  ALTER TABLE actor MODIFY COLUMN middle_name VARCHAR(50) AFTER first_name;

3c. Now delete the middle_name column.
=>  ALTER TABLE actor DROP COLUMN middle_name; 

4a. List the last names of actors, as well as how many actors have that last name.
=>  SELECT last_name, COUNT(last_name) FROM actor group by last_name


4b. List last names of actors and the number of actors who have that last name, but only for names that are shared by at least two actors
=>  SELECT last_name, COUNT(last_name) FROM actor group by last_name
    HAVING COUNT(last_name) > 2;

4c. Oh, no! The actor HARPO WILLIAMS was accidentally entered in the actor table as GROUCHO WILLIAMS, the name of Harpo's second cousin's husband's yoga teacher. Write a query to fix the record.
=>  UPDATE actor SET first_name = 'HARPO' WHERE first_name = 'GROUCHO'
    AND last_name = 'WILLIAMS';

4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing GROUCHO to HARPO. It turns out that GROUCHO was the correct name after all! In a single query, if the first name of the actor is currently HARPO, change it to GROUCHO. Otherwise, change the first name to MUCHO GROUCHO, as that is exactly what the actor will be with the grievous error. BE CAREFUL NOT TO CHANGE THE FIRST NAME OF EVERY ACTOR TO MUCHO GROUCHO, HOWEVER! (Hint: update the record using a unique identifier.)
=>  UPDATE actor SET first_name = 'GROUCHO' WHERE first_name = 'HARPO'
UPDATE actor SET first_name = 'MUCHO GROUCHO' WHERE first_name = 'GROUCHO';

5a. You cannot locate the schema of the address table. Which query would you use to re-create it?
=>  CREATE TABLE `address` (
  `address_id` smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `address` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `address2` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  `district` varchar(20) NOT NULL,
  `city_id` smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL,

  `last_update` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (`address_id`),
  KEY `idx_fk_city_id` (`city_id`),
  SPATIAL KEY `idx_location` (`location`),
  CONSTRAINT `fk_address_city` FOREIGN KEY (`city_id`) REFERENCES `city` (`city_id`) ON UPDATE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=606 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

6a. Use JOIN to display the first and last names, as well as the address, of each staff member. Use the tables staff and address:
=>  SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, a.address
    FROM staff s 
    JOIN address a ON 
    s.address_id = a.address_id;

6b. Use JOIN to display the total amount rung up by each staff member in August of 2005. Use tables staff and payment.
=>  SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, a.address
    FROM staff s 
    JOIN address a ON 
    s.address_id = a.address_id;

6c. List each film and the number of actors who are listed for that film. Use tables film_actor and film. Use inner join.
=>  SELECT f.title,  COUNT(a.actor_id) AS 'number of actors'
    FROM film f 
    JOIN film_actor a ON 
    f.film_id = a.film_id
    Group by (f.title);

6d. How many copies of the film Hunchback Impossible exist in the inventory system?
=>  SELECT COUNT(f.title) AS 'inventory stock for Hunchback' 
    FROM inventory i 
    JOIN film f on 
    f.film_id = i.film_id
    WHERE f.title = 'Hunchback Impossible';

6e. Using the tables payment and customer and the JOIN command, list the total paid by each customer. List the customers alphabetically by last name:
=>  SELECT CONCAT(c.first_name,' ', c.last_name) as customer,
    SUM(p.amount) as payment
    FROM customer c 
    JOIN payment p ON
    c.customer_id = p.customer_id
    Group by customer 
    ORDER BY customer;
7a. The music of Queen and Kris Kristofferson have seen an unlikely resurgence. As an unintended consequence, films starting with the letters K and Q have also soared in popularity. Use subqueries to display the titles of movies starting with the letters K and Q whose language is English.
=>  SELECT title FROM film WHERE language_id IN 
    (SELECT language_id FROM language WHERE name = 'English')
    AND title like "Q%" OR title like "K%"; 

7b. Use subqueries to display all actors who appear in the film Alone Trip.
=>  SELECT Count(actor_id) as 'number of actors' WHERE film_id IN   
   (SELECT film_id FROM film WHERE title = 'Alone Trip')

7c. You want to run an email marketing campaign in Canada, for which you will need the names and email addresses of all Canadian customers. Use joins to retrieve this information.
=>  SELECT CONCAT(first_name,' ', last_name) as name, email
    from customer where address_id in  
    (SELECT address_id from address where city_id IN  
    (SELECT city_id from city where country_id IN
    (SELECT country_id FROM country WHERE country = 'Canada'
    ) 
    )
    );

7d. Sales have been lagging among young families, and you wish to target all family movies for a promotion. Identify all movies categorized as famiy films.
=>  SELECT title FROM film WHERE film_id IN(
    SELECT film_id from film_category WHERE category_id IN(
    (SELECT category_id FROM category WHERE name = 'family')
    )
    ) ;

7e. Display the most frequently rented movies in descending order.
=>  SELECT f.title, COUNT(f.title) as rentals from film f 
    JOIN 
    (SELECT r.rental_id, i.film_id FROM rental r 
    JOIN 
    inventory i ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id) a
    ON a.film_id = f.film_id GROUP BY f.title ORDER BY rentals DESC;

7f. Write a query to display how much business, in dollars, each store brought in.
=>  SELECT address, SUM(amount) as 'total business' from payment p JOIN(		
    SELECT address, rental_id FROM rental r JOIN( 
    SELECT address, inventory_id FROM inventory i
    JOIN (
    SELECT s.store_id as store_id, a.address FROM store s 
    JOIN address a ON a.address_id = s.address_id) b

    JOIN address a ON s.address_id = a.address_id) b ON (b.city_id = c.city_id)
    ) d ON (d.country_id = country.country_id);

7h. List the top five genres in gross revenue in descending order. (Hint: you may need to use the following tables: category, film_category, inventory, payment, and rental.)
=>  SELECT cat.name as category, SUM(d.revenue) as revenue from category cat 
JOIN
    (SELECT catf.category_id, c.revenue FROM film_category catf 
	JOIN 
		(SELECT i.film_id, b.revenue FROM inventory i 
		JOIN 
			(SELECT r.inventory_id, a.revenue from rental r 
			JOIN 
				(SELECT p.rental_id, p.amount as revenue FROM payment p) a 
				ON a.rental_id = r.rental_id) b

		ON c.film_id = catf.film_id) d 
	ON d.category_id = cat.category_id GROUP BY cat.name
  ORDER BY revenue DESC
  LIMIT 5;   

8a. In your new role as an executive, you would like to have an easy way of viewing the Top five genres by gross revenue. Use the solution from the problem above to create a view. If you haven't solved 7h, you can substitute another query to create a view.
=>  CREATE VIEW top_five_genres AS 
SELECT cat.name as category, SUM(d.revenue) as revenue from category cat 
JOIN
    (SELECT catf.category_id, c.revenue FROM film_category catf

		ON c.film_id = catf.film_id) d 
	ON d.category_id = cat.category_id GROUP BY cat.name
  ORDER BY revenue DESC
  LIMIT 5;  

8b. How would you display the view that you created in 8a?
=>  SELECT * FROM sakila.top_five_genres;
