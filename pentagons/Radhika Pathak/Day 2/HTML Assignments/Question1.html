			<p>Probably the most effective way to achieve paragraph<br>
				the central idea of the paragraph in a topic sentence.<br>
				 Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. <br>
				 Like a thesis statement, a topic sentence has a specific main point. <br>Whereas the thesis is the main point of the essay, <br>
				 the topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph. Like the thesis statement, <br>
				  topic sentence has a unifying function. But a thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t <br>
				  uarunified if all the paragraphs relate to the thesis, whereas a paragraph is unified if all the <br>
				  sentences relate to the topic sentence. </p>
