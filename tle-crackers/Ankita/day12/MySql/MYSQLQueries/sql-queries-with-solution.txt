1b.select upper(concat(first_name,' ',last_name)) As Actor_name from sakila.actor;

2a. You need to find the ID number, first name, and last name of an actor, of whom you know only the first name, "Joe." What is one query would you use to obtain this information?
2a. select actor_id,first_name,last_name from actor where first_name="joe";

2b. Find all actors whose last name contain the letters GEN:
2b. select * from actor where last_name like 'GEN%';

2c. Find all actors whose last names contain the letters LI. This time, order the rows by last name and first name, in that order:
2c. select first_name , last_name from actor where last_name like 'li%' order by last_name,first_name;

2d. Using IN, display the country_id and country columns of the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and China:
2d. select country_id, country from country where country in ('afghanistan','bangladesh','china');

3a. Add a middle_name column to the table actor. Position it between first_name and last_name. Hint: you will need to specify the data type.
3a. alter table actor add column middle_name char(100) after first_name;

3b. You realize that some of these actors have tremendously long last names. Change the data type of the middle_name column to blobs.
3b. alter table actor modify column middle_name blob;

3c. Now delete the middle_name column.
3c. alter table actor drop column middle_name;

4b. select last_name, COUNT(last_name) from actor group by last_name having COUNT(last_name) > 2;

4c. Oh, no! The actor HARPO WILLIAMS was accidentally entered in the actor table as GROUCHO WILLIAMS, the name of Harpo's second cousin's husband's yoga teacher. Write a query to fix the record.
4c. update actor set first_name="Harpo" where first_name="grucho" and last_name="williams";

4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing GROUCHO to HARPO. It turns out that GROUCHO was the correct name after all! In a single query, if the first name of the actor is currently HARPO, change it to GROUCHO. Otherwise, change the first name to MUCHO GROUCHO, as that is exactly what the actor will be with the grievous error. BE CAREFUL NOT TO CHANGE THE FIRST NAME OF EVERY ACTOR TO MUCHO GROUCHO, HOWEVER! (Hint: update the record using a unique identifier.)
4d. update actor set first_name="Grucho" where first_name="Harpo" and last_name="williams";
    update actor set first_name="mucho grucho" where first_name="Grucho" and last_name="williams";

5a. You cannot locate the schema of the address table. Which query would you use to re-create it?

6a. Use JOIN to display the first and last names, as well as the address, of each staff member. Use the tables staff and address:
6a. select address.address_id,staff.staff_id,staff.first_name,staff.last_name from address Inner
    join staff on address.address_id=staff.address_id;

6b. Use JOIN to display the total amount rung up by each staff member in August of 2005. Use tables staff and payment.
6b. select concat(staff.first_name,' ',staff.last_name) as 'name',sum(payment.amount) as 'amount' from payment join staff on payment.staff_id=staff.staff_id where payment_date like '2005-08%' group by payment.staff_id;

6c. List each film and the number of actors who are listed for that film. Use tables film_actor and film. Use inner join.

6e. Using the tables payment and customer and the JOIN command, list the total paid by each customer. List the customers alphabetically by last name:

7c. You want to run an email marketing campaign in Canada, for which you will need the names and email addresses of all Canadian customers. Use joins to retrieve this information.
7c. select concat(customer.first_name,'',customer.last_name) as 'name', customer.email as 'email'from customer join address on customer.address_id=address.address_idjoin city on address.city_id=city.city_id
