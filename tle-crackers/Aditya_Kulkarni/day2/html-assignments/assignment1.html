<h1>The Story in the Book </h1>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between copies of Nature
 , <i>New Scientist</i> , and all the other scientific journals her work has appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <i>On The Road</i>.It has been Molly's favorite book since college , 
 and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt needed to be free. </p>
