              Compass Mining has won a $1.5 million court battle against hosting

              Smoke & miners: Myth of BTC network ‘decentralization’ exposed
            </p>
            <p class="content">
              BTC.com data shows that a mere two mining entities—Foundry USA and
              AntPool—currently control over 51% of the BTC network’s overall
              hash rate. Earlier this year, it took the top three BTC mining
              entities to account for a similarly dominant chunk of the overall
              hash pie.
