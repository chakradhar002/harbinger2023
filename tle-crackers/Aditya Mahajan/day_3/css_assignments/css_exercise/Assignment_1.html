            <p class="article_paragraph">A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous car, driver-less car, or robotic car (robo-car),
               is a car that is capable of traveling without human input. Self-driving cars use sensors to perceive
               their surroundings,
               such as optical and thermographic cameras, radar, lidar, ultrasound/sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial
               measurement units.
               Control systems interpret sensory information to create a three-dimensional model of the surroundings. Based
               on the model,
               the car identifies appropriate navigation paths, and strategies for managing traffic controls (stop signs,
               etc.) and
               obstacles.

            <p class="article_paragraph">A flying car or roadable aircraft is a type of vehicle which can function both as a road vehicle 
               and as an aircraft. As used here, this includes vehicles which drive as motorcycles when on the road. The term "flying car" 
               is also sometimes used to include hovercars and/or VTOL personal air vehicles. Many prototypes have been built since the early
               20th century, using a variety of flight technologies. Most have been designed to take off and land conventionally using a
               runway. Although VTOL projects are increasing, none has yet been built in more than a handful of numbers.

            <p class="article_paragraph">Flying cars, or roadable aircraft if you'd prefer, can be more accurately defined as a kind of 
               hybrid road vehicle with fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft capabilities. They are, in other words, part road vehicle,
               part helicopter, and part airplane.
               Quite the eclectic mix. The above is, essentially, a “mechanical” definition, and there is much more to the what a flying car
               actually is than just its physical mechanics. Other systems are also needed to ensure all those different parts work 
               seamlessly together to enable the vehicle to function on roads and in the air. 
               This, at least in modern flying cars, is the realm of software. 
               "Software development in the field of autonomous systems is a crucial component in making these vehicles not just an
               interesting research project, but also an appealing business solution for transportation needs," explains Michele Cavaioni, an 
               engineer who works on flying cars explains. 
               "In short, combined wing capabilities make flying cars possible, and autonomy makes them viable," he adds.
