                    Bacon Sandwich
                    on the day of an unseasonable May snowstorm in Salt Lake City, but fortunately deliciousness knows
                    no season. From top to bottom, the sandwich consists of a Hawaiian bun, honey smokehouse BBQ sauce,
                    Baconwith
                    a brown sugar peeper blend, Colby-Jack cheese, grilled chicken, lettuce, and bun.

                <p class="article_para">How do you like to eat steak? For some it's nice and simple, with potatoes of
                    some form and a side of sauce,
                    maybe some green vegetables, or perhaps you either prefer to throw some Asian flavours into mix?

                    have to many steak recipies. Here then are five steak recipies from Gordon Ramsay, from sauced
                    dishes to sandwhichs. You're sure to find something you like
