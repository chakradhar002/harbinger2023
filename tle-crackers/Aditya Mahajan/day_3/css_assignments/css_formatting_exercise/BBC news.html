            <p class="article_para">aving a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which
                means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business. If
                the business acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions.[6] A business
                structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from
                the business.

                The term is also often used colloquially (but not by lawyers or by public officials) to refer to a
                company, such as a corporation or cooperative. </p>

            <p class="article_para">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as
                transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development
                of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical
                thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education
                results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In
                a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this
                process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. </p>

            <p class="article_para">Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an
                audience or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the
                activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping
                an audience's attention.

                Although people's attention is held by different things because individuals have different preferences,
                most forms of entertainment are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and
                different kinds of performance exist in all cultures and were supported in royal courts and developed
                into sophisticated</p>

            <p class="article_para">Science is a systematic endeavor that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of
                testable explanations and predictions about the universe.[1][2]

                Science may be as old as the human species,[3] and some of the earliest archeological evidence for
                scientific reasoning is tens of thousands of years old. The earliest written records in the history of
                science come from Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 BCE. Their contributions to
                mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity,
                whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on
                natural causes.</p>
