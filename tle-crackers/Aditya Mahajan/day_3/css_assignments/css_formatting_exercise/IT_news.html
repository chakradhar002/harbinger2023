            <span class="date"> <br> <b>Jan 27 2023</b> </span><br><br>
            The health system selected Biofourmis, which can analyze more than 120 biomarkers in real-time, to extend
            hospital-level care to patients across Central Florida. Data from the new hospital-at-home platform will be
            accessible through Orlando Health's Epic electronic health records through a multi-year agreement with the
            connected health and digital therapeutics company.

                Netflix says it plans to halt free password sharing before April
            </span><br>
            <span class="date"> <br> <b>Jan 27 2023</b> </span><br><br>
            Netflix will begin blocking subscribers from sharing their account passwords with people outside of their
            household in the coming months, the video streaming service suggested in a letter to shareholders last week.
            The streaming giant first hinted at plans to restrict Netflix password-sharing between households last
            spring. Netflix piloted a paid-version of account sharing in Latin American countries, where subscribers
            could add a “sub-account” for an additional $3 a month. Now, it plans to roll out paid sharing “more broadly
            later in Q1,” which ends on March 31st.

            The EHR and integrated healthcare IT vendor was hit with the new ransomware variant, in operation since late
            2021. Operations are back to normal, the company reports. The group, also known as ALPHV and suspected to be
            a successor to BlackMatter, has demanded ransoms as high as $1.5M with affiliates keeping 80-90%, according
            to the Office of Information Security at U.S. Health and Human Services and the Health Sector Cybersecurity
            Coordination Center.
