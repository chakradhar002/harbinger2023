		<h1>Breaking News : Cat does not give a damm</h1>

		<p>Domestic cats, especially young kittens, are known for their love of play. This behavior mimics hunting and is important in 
			helping kittens learn to stalk, capture, and kill prey. Cats also engage in play fighting, with each other and with humans.
			This behavior may be a way for cats to practice the skills needed for real combat, and might also reduce any fear they associate
			with launching attacks on other animals.Cats also tend to play with toys more when they are hungry. 
		</p>
		<p>Owing to the close
			similarity between play and hunting, cats prefer to play with objects that resemble prey, such as small furry toys that move rapidly, 
			but rapidly lose interest. They become habituated to a toy they have played with before.
