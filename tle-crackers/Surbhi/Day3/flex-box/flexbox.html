            Language Models for Dialogue
            Weâ€™ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way. The dialogue format makes it
            possible for ChatGPT to answer followup questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject
            inappropriate requests. ChatGPT is a sibling model to InstructGPT, which is trained to follow an instruction in
            a prompt and provide a detailed response.</div>
