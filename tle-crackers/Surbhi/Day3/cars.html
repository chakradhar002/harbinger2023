            <p>A flying car or roadable aircraft is a type of vehicle which can function both as a road vehicle and as
                an aircraft. As used here, this includes vehicles which drive as motorcycles when on the road. The term
                "flying car" is also sometimes used to include hovercars and/or VTOL personal air vehicles. Many
                prototypes have been built since the early 20th century, using a variety of flight technologies. Most
                have been designed to take off and land conventionally using a runway.</p>
